<div align="center">
<p>Our main motivation was to create recommender which does not rely on citations to give recommendations so even less famous
but intriguing papers will also get recommended.</p>


</div>

------------------------------------------
We implemented five different approaches, 'TF-IDF', 'LSTM-based word embeddings', 'Doc2Vec', 'Sentence-BERT' and 'Universal Sentence Encoder(USE)'. TF-IDF gave good result based on specific words. sentence-BERT and USE are good at giving recommendations even query does not have specific key-words. Doc2Vec and LSTM based methods gave poor results. </div>
